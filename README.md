# ML-QSTP-19
Assignments of summer project concerning Machine Learning and its applications
1) ALL THE REQUIRED EXCERCISES ALONG WITH THE OPTIONAL EXCERCISES HAVE BEEN SUCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED

2) Code has been written without use of explicit loops and vectorization of parameters as learned from Andrew Ng's lectures has been used.

3) No. of iterations have been determined on the basis of diffrence in value of consecutive values of cost_function if it was found
to be below an accepted threshold value,the function was asssumed to have converged with a reasonable amount of accuracy.
